 Creational Design Patterns

 Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

 The Builder design pattern solves problems like:

- How can a class (the same construction process) create different representations of a complex object?
- How can a class that includes creating a complex object be simplified?
<br/><br/>

Creating and assembling the parts of a complex object directly within a class is inflexible. It commits the class to creating a particular representation of the complex object and makes it impossible to change the representation later independently from (without having to change) the class.
